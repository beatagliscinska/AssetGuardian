### General Information

Tha application was crafted by a trio of Python developers in just 42 hours, the project embraces the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) approach, enabling rapid development and iteration. Tasks included brainstorming business ideas, architectural design, logical implementation, and integrating front-end elements.

Practicing application development in a team setting, with a well-defined task allocation, the team brought the envisioned concepts to fruition, culminating in the creation of this application.

By adopting the MVP strategy, the team prioritized the development of critical features essential for delivering value to users.

### Main page

The Asset List page provides a centralized display of all assets in the application. Users can interact with the assets by performing actions such as deletion and updating. Clicking the "Delete" or "Update" buttons triggers redirection to the corresponding URLs for executing these actions.

Moreover, the application incorporates functionality for filtering assets and resetting applied filters. Additionally, hover functionality highlights individual asset entries, enhancing user interaction and visual feedback.

The Employees List page provides a comprehensive view of all employees within the application.
Users can explore the list of employees to view their details.
This page serves as a hub for managing employee information.

If a user lacking necessary permissions attempts to update or delete assets, they will be redirected to another page displaying a relevant message.

The "Add Asset" and "Add Employee" forms allow users with required permissions to add new assets and employees to the system.
These forms provide fields for entering relevant information about the asset or employee being added.
Upon submission, the data entered into these forms is processed and stored in the system's database.

Applications implement a custom validation in Add asset form to ensure that each serial number is unique. Raises a validation error if a duplicate serial number is found.

![Example screenshot](./static/images/errorserialno.jpg)

We achieved this thanks to, clean_serial_number, ensures that the entered serial number in a Django form is unique among existing records in the database, raising a validation error if it already exists.To achieve this, it executes a database query excluding the currently edited object, ensuring accurate uniqueness validation.
```bash
    def clean_serial_number(self):
        serial_number = self.cleaned_data['serial_number']
        asset_exists = Asset.objects.exclude(id=self.instance.id).filter(serial_number=serial_number).exists()
        if asset_exists:
            raise forms.ValidationError("Serial number already exists. Please provide a unique serial number.")
        return serial_number

````
The application includes login and sign-up functionality.

The profile page provides functionality for reviewing and updating user information.
Users can review their profile data and update it as necessary.

### Room for Improvement

To be improved:
- Implement constraints for usernames and passwords to ensure they meet security standards, such as minimum length, special character requirements, and password complexity.
- Introduce a password reset functionality that sends a reset link to the user's email address. This would enhance security and provide a convenient way for users to regain access to their accounts.
- Enhance the user interface by adding a dropdown list to allow employees to select their manager from a predefined list. This would improve the clarity and ease of use of the application's interface.
